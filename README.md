## Purpose
<!-- Share story -->
I've been playing chess for about 9 years and coding for 2 years.  I've always wanted to combine my two passions together and code my own chess engine utilizing strategies that I gained over years of practice.  Also, with chess being more prominent in media than ever before thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is no better time to start this project than now!
